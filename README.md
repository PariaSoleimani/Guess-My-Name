# Project Name

Guess My Number

# Project Overview

This fully responsive project is a simple "Guess My Number" game, originally styled with plain CSS and I later upgraded to Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design. The JavaScript code has also been refactored for better readability and performance. The game allows users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, providing feedback on their guesses until they find the correct number.
